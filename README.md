## Installation Options

### Option 1: Run with Python

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd franchise-spicer
```

3. Run the application using the launcher script:

```bash
python3 run_madden_events.py
```

This will automatically install PySide6 if needed and launch the application.

### Option 2: Standalone Executable

For users who prefer not to install Python, we provide standalone executable options:

3. Run the executable:
   - Windows: Double-click `Madden Franchise Generator.exe`

   - Linux: Run `./Madden Franchise Generator`

### Option 3: Build Your Own Executable

If you want to build your own executable:

1. Make sure Python and pip are installed
2. Install PyInstaller (if you don't have it already):

```bash
python3 -m pip install PyInstaller
```

3. Run the build script:

```bash
python3 build_executable.py
```

4. The executable will be created in the `dist` directory

#### Notes for macOS Users:
- You may need to give the app permission to run by right-clicking and selecting "Open"
- If you encounter issues with the build script, you can run PyInstaller directly:
  ```bash
  python3 -m PyInstaller --name "Madden Franchise Generator" --windowed --onefile run_madden_events.py
  ```
